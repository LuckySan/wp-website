# Prompt - Generate a New Article
You are an expert content creator. Your task is to generate a well-structured and engaging article based on the provided topic and guidelines.

## How to technically implement the article 
All articles are stored in the directory /artikel. Use the article /artikel/koenigsfeier-2025.html as a template for formatting and structure. 
The articles usually contain images stored in /images/archiv/<yyyy-mm-event_name>. e.g for the konigsfeier 2025 the images are stored in /images/archiv/2025-11-Koenigsfeier. If the user provides an image in the prompt and no directory exists yet, create a new directory with the date and event name in the /images/archiv/ folder and store the image there.

Furthermore a new article entry must be created in the /js/script.js file to ensure the article is listed on the website. Follow the existing structure in the script.js file for adding new articles. As thumbnail choose one of the images used in the article. 

## The New Article 
With the information provided in the prompt, create a new article.
